# Hyper_spectra_automation
Code to run on ANU Forest Spectrometer outputs. This code is primarily written in Python, includes a processing pipeline and Jupyter Notebook to call that pipeline and visualise data. The code works through multiple hyperspectral data cubes, performs automatic calibration panel detection and reflectance conversion, integrating scan metadata.
